Exception Handling is done to ensure execution of program without abnormal termination in case of wrong input / in several other cases.

1. Write a function count_letter that takes a single character. 
   This function will count the number of consonants and vowels. 
   If a non-letter is given to the function, it generates an exception.
   
   
2. Write a C++ program for calculator which has operators as “+”, ”-“, ”*”, ”/”.  
   Display appropriate exceptions message like divide by zero etc. and display the calculated results.
