Inheritance

1. Write a C++ program to create a base class called FURNITURE. 
   Derive three classes called CHAIR, BOOKSHELF, COT. 
   Consider that FURNITURE class has members like color, width, height. 
   The CHAIR class and the COT class have a data member number of legs and the BOOKSHELF class has number of shelves as data member. 
   Override data members of the FURNITURE class to accept and display the details of given furniture.

2. Design a base class person (name, address, phone_no). 
   Derive a class employee (e_no, ename) from person. 
   Derive a class manager (designation, department, basic_salary) from employee. 
   Write a menu driven program to: 
     => Accept all details of ‘n’ manager. 
     => Display manager having highest salary. (Use private inheritance). 

3. A company markets books audio tapes. 
   Prepare a class publication having members (title, price). 
   From this class derive two classes Book which adds a page count and Tape which adds a playing time in minutes. 
   The program should contain following menu.
    => Display all books. 
    => Display all tapes. 
    => All books having pages>n. 
    => All tapes having playing time>=n minutes. 

4. Implement using dynamic binding for the following scenario to calculate the area of the shape as per the user’s choice:
   
   Shape Class (Base class) ,Rectangle ,Circle and Triangle (inherited from Shape).

   Create base class called shape. 
   Use this class to store two double type values that could be used to compute the area of figures. 
   Derive three specific classes called triangle, circle and rectangle from the base shape. 
   Add to the base class, a member function get_data() to initialize base class data members and display_area() to compute and display area. 
   Make display_area() as a virtual function.
