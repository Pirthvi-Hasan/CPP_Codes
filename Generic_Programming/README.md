The method of Generic Programming is implemented to increase the efficiency of the code. 
Generic Programming enables the programmer to write a general algorithm which will work with all data types.


1.  Design a template to find the largest among three numbers of different data types.


2.	Write a .cpp program for class template: 
    Two classes one is Civil_Time and Another is Railway_Time.  
    Enter hours and minutes in Railway time (24 hour format) and display the time in Civil time (12 hour format with a.m. and p.m.) using one class type to another class type conversion.
